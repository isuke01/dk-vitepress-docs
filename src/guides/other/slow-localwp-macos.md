# Slow Local WP (9.2 + ) Mac OS after update

There is bug/issue with when doing update recently.
First of all. Recent MAC updated + electron apps + rosetta getting worst. And if you are on Old Intel’s version of Local WP new version will work Super slow, painfully slow…

Also there is bug/issue where even if you are on Local WP Apple Silicon version (my case) did just auto update it updates to non Apple Silicon! Which make it super slow :open_mouth:
The fix!

Simply manual update. Go to https://localwp.com/releases/ and get The Apple Silicon version and just install this one (replace the app)
After this works as it should again

Another note!
If you are facing issue with can’t start site etc, disable the DK Local Extension, as it is not updated to recent version, as ain’t nobody get time for that
