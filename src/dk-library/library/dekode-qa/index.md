# Dekode QA

![Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

This plugin works as "ask anonymous questions" and "answer anonymous questions". When users ask questions they can tick a radio button for allowing the question to be published publicly or if the question and answer is only for them to see.

* New questions posted will be added for admin to read, edit, and respond to. 
* All questions (posts) will be password protected and admins can decide when to publish the question for other users to read.
* Questioners will be provided with a unique url to their question to revisit to see if any answer is given. 
* Questioners will also be provided with a unique code to lookup their question from a search question form.
* Admin can change the default name of the question post (defaults to the unique code). The post slug will be autmatically updateing using the title on save.
* Admin can potentially be notified by new questions adding email address(es) in the question form block.

Note: This plugin was made when working on this solution for NKVTS - Din utvei - SpÃ¸r oss. The plugin is styled and added some javascript functionality specific for that project in a custom theme. Check out the theme in the [repository](https://github.com/DekodeInteraktiv/nkvts-new/tree/stage/packages/themes/dinutvei-theme) for details.
