# Yet another hero block.

![Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

The block utilizes the yoast breadcumbs if installed and post title.
Allows to set a background image.
Allows to set light or dark theme as it was part of the design and there was no need for more complexity.
Will display featured image on the side if used.

Orignally developed for Litex design.
